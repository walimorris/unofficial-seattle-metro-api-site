# How to Contribute

What's up! Thanks for taking a look at this `How to Contribute Page`. As this is a small project being stood up, we
still welcome developers to contribute. This is a small Single Page Application written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) 
for the Unofficial Seattle Metro API [here](https://github.com/walimorris/unofficial-seattle-metro-api). 

Here are some important resources: 

* [Vue.js Conditional Rendering](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional.html)
* [Vue.js Lifecycle Hooks](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html)
* [Using Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/accessing-your-user-pools-using-the-amazon-cognito-identity-sdk-for-javascript/)


## Submitting Changes

You can read about creating pull requests [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). We welcome all pull requests.
When raising a pull request, you should include in detail what changes, updates, or additions you're making. Much Appreciated.
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

Bigger changes should be more descriptive:

```
$ git commit -m "updated some feature in this package that details any new functionality"
```

There are two main branches: master and develop. All development branches should be created off of the develop branch. 
The develop branch will then be merged into the master branch on releases. All branches you create should be descriptive 
and based off of the feature you're working on and created off of the develop branch like such: 

`git checkout -b your-feature-name`

Thanks!
